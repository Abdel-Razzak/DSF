    "During this session we hightlight the importance and role of data Engineering (Data Infrastructure or Data Architecture) process in data analysis. The data engineer gathers and collects the data, stores it, does batch processing or real-time processing on it, and serves it via an API to a data scientist who can easily query it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important part of this session is data preprocessing where The quality of the data and the amount of useful information that it contains are key factors that determine how well a machine learning algorithm can learn. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that we make sure to examine and preprocess a dataset before we feed it to a learning algorithm. In this session, we will discuss the essential data preprocessing techniques that will help us to build good machine learning models.\n",

    "* understand Data Preprocessing stages and its role in developing data process model\n",
    "* apply learned techniques to develop a data science model\n",
