    "# Comprehensions\n",
    "## Session Background\n",
    "In Python programming, especially when you're dealing with data, there are many cases where you want to iterate over list or dict, perform an operation on every element, and then collect all the results in a new list or dict. You can certainly do that with a For Loop, but Python offers a great feature, comprehensions, that lets you write shorter and clearer code that achieves the same effect. In this session, we're going to review how to write loops as comprehensions, how to apply them only to select items, and how to do the same for lists and for dicts.\n",

    "* Rewrite a loop as a comprhension\n",
    "* Filter items\n",
    "* Create a dict from a comprehension"

    "I should also mention that you see a naked comprehension, so to speak, without brackets. That's actually a slightly different Python construct known as generator expression.

For instance, if we wanted to take the sum of the first 10 squares, we may first write the list i ** 2 for i in range [10], and then feed the list to the Python function sum."
