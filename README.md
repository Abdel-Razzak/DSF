# Data Engineering: 
During this session we hightlight the importance and role of data Engineering (Data Infrastructure or Data Architecture) process in data analysis. The data engineer gathers and collects the data, stores it, does batch processing or real-time processing on it, and serves it via an API to a data scientist who can easily query it.

One important part of this session is data preprocessing where The quality of the data and the amount of useful information that it contains are key factors that determine how well a machine learning algorithm can learn. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that we make sure to examine and preprocess a dataset before we feed it to a learning algorithm. In this session, we will discuss the essential data preprocessing techniques that will help us to build good machine learning models.

## Objectives: Data preprocessing
During this session participants will be able to:
  
* understand importance role of data Engineering 
* implement and apply several data aquistion  and preporcessing techniques using python
* understand Data Preprocessing stages and its role in developing data process model
* apply learned techniques to develop a data science model

## The topics that we will cover in this session are as follows:
* Removing and imputing missing values from the dataset
* Getting categorical data into shape for machine learning algorithms
* Selecting relevant features for the model construction
