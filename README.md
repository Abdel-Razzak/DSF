# Data-Science-Fundamentals
In this course, we'll get a comprehensive overview of data science, a growing field that combines coding, math, statistics, and often business acumen. The workshop will start by showing you the entire process for data science projects and the different roles and skills that are needed. Then the basics of obtaining data through a variety of sources are introduced to you, including web APIs and page scraping. 

Through training workshop program, python programming language is introduced and used as the primary tool in handling, analyzing, visualizing and presenting data. Participants will get a full understanding of how to program with python and how to use it in conjunction with scientific computing modules and libraries to analyze data. 

We'll also take a look at powerful techniques for analyzing data. We'll be covering techniques for planning, performing, and presenting your projects to help you get started in data science and making the most of the data that's all around you. And so let's get started with Introduction to Data Science.
