# Introduction to Machine Learning (6 hours)
In this session we will be focusing on very practical hands on applications of machine learning using the SciKit Learn module for Python.
Install it using either pip install scikit-learn or conda install scikit-learn depending on your installation.
You can treat each session almost like a micro-project. In each lecture we'll get a brief overview of the mathematics behind the model we'll work with and then dive into the code.
