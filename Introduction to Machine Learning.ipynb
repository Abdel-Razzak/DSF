    "### What you can expect to learn from the machine learning section of this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "I've geared this section of the workshop with one main goal in mind: you having a basic understanding of the mathematics behind some machine learning techniques and more importantly: being able to use the scikit learn library with Python to implement those techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Once you're done with this workshop you should feel comfortable putting SciKit Learn on your resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a very broad topic and we relistically won't be able to cover every thing, especially the higher level mathematics of some methods, but you should have enough material presented here to feel confident in your ability to look at a dataset, choose a model, and then know how to apply SciKit Learn to analyze your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many free online resources to further expand your knowledge on Machine Learning. I've listed a few of the ones I personally recommend here:"
