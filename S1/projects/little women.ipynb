       "'ONE\\r\\n\\r\\nPLAYING PILGRIMS\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Christmas won\\'t be Christmas without any presents,\" grumbled Jo, lying\\r\\non the rug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s so dreadful to be poor!\" sighed Meg, looking down at her old\\r\\ndress.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think it\\'s fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty\\r\\nthings, and other girls nothing at all,\" added little Amy, with an\\r\\ninjured sniff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ve got Father and Mother, and each other,\" said Beth contentedly\\r\\nfrom her corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the\\r\\ncheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, \"We haven\\'t got\\r\\nFather, and shall not have him for a long time.\" She didn\\'t say\\r\\n\"perhaps never,\" but each silently added it, thinking of Father far\\r\\naway, where the fighting was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, \"You know\\r\\nthe reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was\\r\\nbecause it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we\\r\\nought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in\\r\\nthe army.  We can\\'t do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and\\r\\nought to do it gladly.  But I am afraid I don\\'t,\" and Meg shook her\\r\\nhead, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t think the little we should spend would do any good.  We\\'ve\\r\\neach got a dollar, and the army wouldn\\'t be much helped by our giving\\r\\nthat.  I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want\\r\\nto buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself.  I\\'ve wanted it so long,\" said\\r\\nJo, who was a bookworm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\\r\\nwhich no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall get a nice box of Faber\\'s drawing pencils; I really need\\r\\nthem,\" said Amy decidedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mother didn\\'t say anything about our money, and she won\\'t wish us to\\r\\ngive up everything.  Let\\'s each buy what we want, and have a little\\r\\nfun; I\\'m sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the\\r\\nheels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I\\'m\\r\\nlonging to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\\r\\nlike to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\\r\\nyou trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you\\'re ready to\\r\\nfly out the window or cry?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\\r\\ntidy is the worst work in the world.  It makes me cross, and my hands\\r\\nget so stiff, I can\\'t practice well at all.\" And Beth looked at her\\r\\nrough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy, \"for you don\\'t\\r\\nhave to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you\\r\\ndon\\'t know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your\\r\\nfather if he isn\\'t rich, and insult you when your nose isn\\'t nice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you mean libel, I\\'d say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa\\r\\nwas a pickle bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know what I mean, and you needn\\'t be statirical about it. It\\'s\\r\\nproper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,\" returned Amy,\\r\\nwith dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t peck at one another, children.  Don\\'t you wish we had the money\\r\\nPapa lost when we were little, Jo?  Dear me! How happy and good we\\'d\\r\\nbe, if we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the\\r\\nKing children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\\r\\nspite of their money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I did, Beth.  Well, I think we are.  For though we do have to work,\\r\\nwe make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\\r\\nthe long figure stretched on the rug.\\r\\n\\r\\nJo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to\\r\\nwhistle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t, Jo.  It\\'s so boyish!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s why I do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I detest rude, unladylike girls!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Birds in their little nests agree,\" sang Beth, the peacemaker, with\\r\\nsuch a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\\r\\n\"pecking\" ended for that time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\\r\\nlecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\\r\\nboyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.  It didn\\'t matter so\\r\\nmuch when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up\\r\\nyour hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m not!   And if turning up my hair makes me one, I\\'ll wear it in two\\r\\ntails till I\\'m twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down\\r\\na chestnut mane.  \"I hate to think I\\'ve got to grow up, and be Miss\\r\\nMarch, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster!  It\\'s\\r\\nbad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy\\'s games and work and\\r\\nmanners!  I can\\'t get over my disappointment in not being a boy.  And\\r\\nit\\'s worse than ever now, for I\\'m dying to go and fight with Papa. And\\r\\nI can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like\\r\\ncastanets, and her ball bounded across the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Poor Jo!  It\\'s too bad, but it can\\'t be helped.  So you must try to be\\r\\ncontented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us\\r\\ngirls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head with a hand that all the\\r\\ndish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its\\r\\ntouch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular\\r\\nand prim.  Your airs are funny now, but you\\'ll grow up an affected\\r\\nlittle goose, if you don\\'t take care. I like your nice manners and\\r\\nrefined ways of speaking, when you don\\'t try to be elegant.  But your\\r\\nabsurd words are as bad as Jo\\'s slang.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,\\r\\nready to share the lecture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly, and no one\\r\\ncontradicted her, for the \\'Mouse\\' was the pet of the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs young readers like to know \\'how people look\\', we will take this\\r\\nmoment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat\\r\\nknitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly\\r\\nwithout, and the fire crackled cheerfully within.  It was a comfortable\\r\\nroom, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a\\r\\ngood picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,\\r\\nchrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a\\r\\npleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being\\r\\nplump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet\\r\\nmouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old\\r\\nJo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she\\r\\nnever seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\\r\\nmuch in her way.  She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\\r\\ngray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\\r\\nfunny, or thoughtful.  Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it\\r\\nwas usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way.  Round shoulders\\r\\nhad Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the\\r\\nuncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a\\r\\nwoman and didn\\'t like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her,\\r\\nwas a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\\r\\nmanner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom\\r\\ndisturbed.  Her father called her \\'Little Miss Tranquility\\', and the\\r\\nname suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of\\r\\nher own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.\\r\\nAmy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own\\r\\nopinion at least.  A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow\\r\\nhair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying\\r\\nherself like a young lady mindful of her manners.  What the characters\\r\\nof the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair\\r\\nof slippers down to warm.  Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a\\r\\ngood effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and everyone\\r\\nbrightened to welcome her.  Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the\\r\\nlamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked, and Jo forgot\\r\\nhow tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the\\r\\nblaze.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are quite worn out.  Marmee must have a new pair.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought I\\'d get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided, \"I\\'m the man\\r\\nof the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide the slippers, for\\r\\nhe told me to take special care of Mother while he was gone.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do,\" said Beth, \"let\\'s each get her something\\r\\nfor Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s like you, dear!  What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as if the\\r\\nidea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give\\r\\nher a nice pair of gloves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll get a little bottle of cologne.  She likes it, and it won\\'t cost\\r\\nmuch, so I\\'ll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.\\r\\nDon\\'t you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair\\r\\nwith the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the\\r\\npresents, with a kiss.  I liked the things and the kisses, but it was\\r\\ndreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\"\\r\\nsaid Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then\\r\\nsurprise her.  We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg. There is so\\r\\nmuch to do about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up\\r\\nand down, with her hands behind her back, and her nose in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t mean to act any more after this time.  I\\'m getting too old for\\r\\nsuch things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about\\r\\n\\'dressing-up\\' frolics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You won\\'t stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown\\r\\nwith your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best\\r\\nactress we\\'ve got, and there\\'ll be an end of everything if you quit the\\r\\nboards,\" said Jo.  \"We ought to rehearse tonight.  Come here, Amy, and\\r\\ndo the fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I can\\'t help it.  I never saw anyone faint, and I don\\'t choose to make\\r\\nmyself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do.  If I can go down\\r\\neasily, I\\'ll drop.  If I can\\'t, I shall fall into a chair and be\\r\\ngraceful.  I don\\'t care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\"\\r\\nreturned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen\\r\\nbecause she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain\\r\\nof the piece.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do it this way.  Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,\\r\\ncrying frantically, \\'Roderigo! Save me! Save me!\\'\" and away went Jo,\\r\\nwith a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and\\r\\njerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her \"Ow!\" was\\r\\nmore suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish.\\r\\nJo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let\\r\\nher bread burn as she watched the fun with interest. \"It\\'s no use!  Do\\r\\nthe best you can when the time comes, and if the audience laughs, don\\'t\\r\\nblame me.  Come on, Meg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech\\r\\nof two pages without a single break.  Hagar, the witch, chanted an\\r\\nawful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird\\r\\neffect.  Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in\\r\\nagonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, \"Ha! Ha!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s the best we\\'ve had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and\\r\\nrubbed his elbows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo.\\r\\nYou\\'re a regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that\\r\\nher sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly.  \"I do think _The Witches Curse, an\\r\\nOperatic Tragedy_ is rather a nice thing, but I\\'d like to try\\r\\n_Macbeth_, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo.  I always wanted to do\\r\\nthe killing part.  \\'Is that a dagger that I see before me?\" muttered\\r\\nJo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous\\r\\ntragedian do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, it\\'s the toasting fork, with Mother\\'s shoe on it instead of the\\r\\nbread.  Beth\\'s stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a\\r\\ngeneral burst of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,\\r\\nand actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a\\r\\n\\'can I help you\\' look about her which was truly delightful. She was not\\r\\nelegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the\\r\\ngray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in\\r\\nthe world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, dearies, how have you got on today?  There was so much to do,\\r\\ngetting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn\\'t come home to\\r\\ndinner.  Has anyone called, Beth?  How is your cold, Meg?  Jo, you look\\r\\ntired to death.  Come and kiss me, baby.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things\\r\\noff, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew Amy\\r\\nto her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day.  The\\r\\ngirls flew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own\\r\\nway.  Meg arranged the tea table, Jo brought wood and set chairs,\\r\\ndropping, over-turning, and clattering everything she touched.  Beth\\r\\ntrotted to and fro between parlor kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy\\r\\ngave directions to everyone, as she sat with her hands folded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly\\r\\nhappy face, \"I\\'ve got a treat for you after supper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth\\r\\nclapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up\\r\\nher napkin, crying, \"A letter!  A letter!  Three cheers for Father!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, a nice long letter.  He is well, and thinks he shall get through\\r\\nthe cold season better than we feared.  He sends all sorts of loving\\r\\nwishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.\\r\\nMarch, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hurry and get done!  Don\\'t stop to quirk your little finger and simper\\r\\nover your plate, Amy,\" cried Jo, choking on her tea and dropping her\\r\\nbread, butter side down, on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood\\r\\nover the delight to come, till the others were ready.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain when he was too\\r\\nold to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\" said Meg\\r\\nwarmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan--what\\'s its name?  Or a\\r\\nnurse, so I could be near him and help him,\" exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of\\r\\nbad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\" sighed Amy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When will he come home, Marmee?\" asked Beth, with a little quiver in\\r\\nher voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick.  He will stay and do his\\r\\nwork faithfully as long as he can, and we won\\'t ask for him back a\\r\\nminute sooner than he can be spared.  Now come and hear the letter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth at her\\r\\nfeet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on\\r\\nthe back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter\\r\\nshould happen to be touching.  Very few letters were written in those\\r\\nhard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent\\r\\nhome.  In this one little was said of the hardships endured, the\\r\\ndangers faced, or the homesickness conquered. It was a cheerful,\\r\\nhopeful letter, full of lively descriptions of camp life, marches, and\\r\\nmilitary news, and only at the end did the writer\\'s heart over-flow\\r\\nwith fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give them all of my dear love and a kiss.  Tell them I think of them\\r\\nby day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their\\r\\naffection at all times.  A year seems very long to wait before I see\\r\\nthem, but remind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these\\r\\nhard days need not be wasted.  I know they will remember all I said to\\r\\nthem, that they will be loving children to you, will do their duty\\r\\nfaithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves\\r\\nso beautifully that when I come back to them I may be fonder and\\r\\nprouder than ever of my little women.\" Everybody sniffed when they came\\r\\nto that part.  Jo wasn\\'t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the\\r\\nend of her nose, and Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she\\r\\nhid her face on her mother\\'s shoulder and sobbed out, \"I am a selfish\\r\\ngirl!  But I\\'ll truly try to be better, so he mayn\\'t be disappointed in\\r\\nme by-and-by.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We all will,\" cried Meg.  \"I think too much of my looks and hate to\\r\\nwork, but won\\'t any more, if I can help it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll try and be what he loves to call me, \\'a little woman\\' and not be\\r\\nrough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere\\r\\nelse,\" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much\\r\\nharder task than facing a rebel or two down South.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and\\r\\nbegan to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that\\r\\nlay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all\\r\\nthat Father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy\\r\\ncoming home.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo\\'s words, by saying in her\\r\\ncheery voice, \"Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress\\r\\nwhen you were little things?  Nothing delighted you more than to have\\r\\nme tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and\\r\\nsticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from\\r\\nthe cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop,\\r\\nwhere you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a\\r\\nCelestial City.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and\\r\\npassing through the valley where the hob-goblins were,\" said Jo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs,\"\\r\\nsaid Meg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I don\\'t remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar\\r\\nand the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the\\r\\ntop.  If I wasn\\'t too old for such things, I\\'d rather like to play it\\r\\nover again,\" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things\\r\\nat the mature age of twelve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are\\r\\nplaying all the time in one way or another.  Our burdens are here, our\\r\\nroad is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the\\r\\nguide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace\\r\\nwhich is a true Celestial City.  Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you\\r\\nbegin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can\\r\\nget before Father comes home.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Really, Mother?  Where are our bundles?\" asked Amy, who was a very\\r\\nliteral young lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth. I rather\\r\\nthink she hasn\\'t got any,\" said her mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I have.  Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice\\r\\npianos, and being afraid of people.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeth\\'s bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh, but\\r\\nnobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us do it,\" said Meg thoughtfully.  \"It is only another name for\\r\\ntrying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do want to\\r\\nbe good, it\\'s hard work and we forget, and don\\'t do our best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came and pulled\\r\\nus out as Help did in the book.  We ought to have our roll of\\r\\ndirections, like Christian.  What shall we do about that?\" asked Jo,\\r\\ndelighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull\\r\\ntask of doing her duty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look under your pillows Christmas morning, and you will find your\\r\\nguidebook,\" replied Mrs. March.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table, then\\r\\nout came the four little work baskets, and the needles flew as the\\r\\ngirls made sheets for Aunt March.  It was uninteresting sewing, but\\r\\ntonight no one grumbled.  They adopted Jo\\'s plan of dividing the long\\r\\nseams into four parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa,\\r\\nand America, and in that way got on capitally, especially when they\\r\\ntalked about the different countries as they stitched their way through\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they went to bed.\\r\\nNo one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had\\r\\na way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant\\r\\naccompaniment to the simple songs they sang.  Meg had a voice like a\\r\\nflute, and she and her mother led the little choir.  Amy chirped like a\\r\\ncricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always\\r\\ncoming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the\\r\\nmost pensive tune.  They had always done this from the time they could\\r\\nlisp...\\r\\n\\r\\n    Crinkle, crinkle, \\'ittle \\'tar,\\r\\n\\r\\nand it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.\\r\\nThe first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the\\r\\nhouse singing like a lark, and the last sound at night was the same\\r\\ncheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar\\r\\nlullaby.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
